APP NAME: Decision Making Tree App

The purpose of this app is to allow users to have fun creating and using/playing with a decision making tree. 
First, the chooses a posted decisionTree. Then, a question will appear as title.. "Should I drink beer?"
If the user follows by clicking the submit button, the next question pops up.. E.g. "Are you 21+?" ... Until he reaches the final question.

Without ajax and javascript, this app would have to reload every single time a form is submitted.. Because there can be a lot of content, this would have 
been very expensive from the perspective of data transfer.

This project also implements a login-register design similar to p2. This is done via php, of course.
Thank you for everything, and enjoy.
